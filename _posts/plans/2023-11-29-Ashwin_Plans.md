# ASCII
## Week 1
This week I learned about the different types of binary logic, and some of the features that I could make with them. I am leaning towards a ASCII image generator, that would allow a user to imput a image and have it be converted into ascii. I was also working on the SASS of our repository, to make the body and headers have a different color. While working with my team I chose a cream color to go with our title page. We also have our team teach next week so I will also be working on that

## Week 2
I made a first iteration of my ASCII code but I am having issues with the image scaling. We had our first review and Mr Mort gave us some feedback. He said that I should add a feature to scale the images, and also to make the feature easier to use for a user that doesnt know what ASCII is. I agree with this and will try to add some way to choose the size/detail of each of the images. I will also add a discription to the top about what ascii is so everyone can understand what my feture does

## Week 3
