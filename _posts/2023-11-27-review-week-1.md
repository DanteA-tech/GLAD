## Goal
Integrate Binary and SASS into a practice project to prepare for our passion projct.
## Elements
1. Convert RGB Color Codes to Binary:
HTML Structure: Similar to the previous plan.
SASS Integration:
Create a SASS file for styling, e.g., styles/main.scss.
Use SASS features to style color display areas, input areas, and buttons.
The JavaScript implementation remains the same as described earlier.
2. Convert messages to binary format for color display:
HTML Structure: Similar to the previous structure.
SASS Integration:
Create a SASS file for styling, e.g., styles/main.scss.
Use SASS to style message displays, placeholders, and buttons.
The JavaScript implementation remains the same as described earlier.
3. Logic Gates Interface Display:
HTML Structure: Similar to the previous structure.
SASS Integration:
Create a SASS file for styling, e.g., styles/main.scss.
Use SASS for styling buttons, input fields, display locations, and logic gate simulation locations.
The JavaScript implementation remains the same as described earlier.
4. Binary/Decimal Numbers:
HTML Structure: Similar to the previous structure.
SASS Integration:
Create SASS files for styling, e.g., styles/main.scss.
Utilize SASS for styling input fields, buttons, display area, and calculator components.
JavaScript Functionality: Remains the same as previously outlined.
Steps to integrate SASS:
Create SASS File Structure: Set up a folder structure for SASS files.
Write SASS Styles: Utilize SASS features to style HTML elements and components.
Compile SASS to CSS: Use npm scripts or build tools to compile SASS files into CSS.
Link Compiled CSS in HTML/JavaScript: Link the compiled CSS file in your HTML file or import it into your JavaScript components.
Considerations:
SASS Organization: Organize SASS files using partials, mixins, and variables for better maintainability.
Compile Workflow: Ensure that SASS compilation is part of your development workflow.
File Structure: Keep the SASS file structure consistent and aligned with your JavaScript components for easier management.
By integrating SASS into your JavaScript project, you can leverage its capabilities to improve the styling aspects of your tools while keeping the JavaScript functionalities intact.
## Code we made or are working on
- We made an RGB adjuster in which you select an image and can change how prominent the red, green, or blue is
- We are working on a binary decimal converter, we have some code, however, we are experiencing issues with it 
- We are working on a text to color converter that converts text into the ASCII value to an 8 bit binary number that will be converted to an rgb value.
# Comments
Dante and Aswhin: 0.95/1 I loved the plans and the usage of the RGB selector and customizer and AI usage. I also loved the interactive features. Can improve with more customization Lincoln and Gurshawn: 0.94/1 I loved your plans for a text to color converter. This feature was fun to use and the effort put in was great. There was a slight lack of plans but it was still great. Could be improved with more tangible code.
