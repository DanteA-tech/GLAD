## What is our CPT project


## What each of the four parts are
1. One of the 4 components will be the menu screen of the game that has character selection, different jersey options, and player statistics. This will involve the binary aspect which will deal with color selection of the jerseys. Daunte will be doing this part.
2. The other component will be the point scoring part of the game. 
3. Sass is another component and this will hold our style tags, head, and body tags. This is essentially the design of the game and revolves around the idea that our style tags are centralized and how we do not have body or head tags in our .md files. Ashwin will be doing this part.
4. The final part of the project will be the binary aspect which will deal with color selection of the jerseys
