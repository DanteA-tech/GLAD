## Goal
Integrate Binary and SASS into a practice project to prepare for our passion projct.
## Elements
Binary - convert RGB color codes to binary 
Color Code - convert messages into binary which will be converted into color.
Logic Gates- interactive place where buttons are pressed to show what gates do based on true/false values if a light turns off and on
Math In Binary-  Binary/Decimal calculator that shows the steps between conversion including left/right shifts if specified

1. Convert RGB Color Codes to Binary:
HTML Structure: Similar to the previous plan.
SASS Integration:
Create SASS files for styling, e.g., styles/main.scss.
Utilize SASS features for styling the color display area, input fields, and buttons.
JavaScript Functionality: Remains the same as previously outlined.
2. Convert Messages into Binary for Color Display:
HTML Structure: Similar to the previous plan.
SASS Integration:
Create a SASS file for styling, e.g., styles/main.scss.
Use SASS to style message displays, placeholders, and buttons.
The JavaScript implementation remains the same as described earlier.
3. Logic Gates Interface Display:
HTML Structure: Similar to the previous structure.
SASS Integration:
Create a SASS file for styling, e.g., styles/main.scss.
Use SASS for styling buttons, input fields, display locations, and logic gate simulation locations.
The JavaScript implementation remains the same as described earlier.
4. Binary/Decimal Numbers:
HTML Structure: Similar to the previous structure.
SASS Integration:
Create SASS files for styling, e.g., styles/main.scss.
Utilize SASS for styling input fields, buttons, display area, and calculator components.
JavaScript Functionality: Remains the same as previously outlined.
Steps to integrate SASS:
Create SASS File Structure: Set up a folder structure for SASS files.
Write SASS Styles: Utilize SASS features to style HTML elements and components.
Compile SASS to CSS: Use npm scripts or build tools to compile SASS files into CSS.
Link Compiled CSS in HTML/JavaScript: Link the compiled CSS file in your HTML file or import it into your JavaScript components.
Considerations:
SASS Organization: Organize SASS files using partials, mixins, and variables for better maintainability.
Compile Workflow: Ensure that SASS compilation is part of your development workflow.
File Structure: Keep the SASS file structure consistent and aligned with your JavaScript components for easier management.
By integrating SASS into your JavaScript project, you can leverage its capabilities to improve the styling aspects of your tools while keeping the JavaScript functionalities intact.
